CEPAlgorithms:
-some method parameters (matrix regularization, sparsity, etc.) are still hard-coded
-fix SCA to use calculated frequencies
-0 vs. 1 position inconsistency (causes headaches but no errors)
-RPMI occasionally gives a funky error

CEPPipeline:
-options checker at the beginning to look for incompatible options
-wrap parameters into another object for easier specification and passing (config file?)
-remove mapping to canonical sequence positions from compute_networks; easier to compare multiple canonicals this way
-make it easier to compute alternate statistics - different acc/rep defs, etc. after having already done the network scoring
-make restarts easier
-improve __str__ for the pipeline, giving help message with a summary of the program options
-remove double counting of canonical sequence
-passing in parameters (angCut, linSep) to the CASP contact calculator
-unit testing?

CEPPlotting:
-utility for nice plot of consensus graphs
-flag for turning legend on and off
-remove/update deprecated plotting functions
-unit tests?

CEPPreprocessing:
-unit tests?

CEPStructures:
-fix up calculate_distances_offset
