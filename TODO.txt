CEPAlgorithms:
-some method parameters (matrix regularization, sparsity, etc.) are still hard-coded
-fix SCA to use calculated frequencies
-0 vs. 1 position inconsistency (causes headaches but no errors)
-RPMI occasionally gives a funky error

CEPPipeline:
-options checker at the beginning to look for incompatible options
-wrap parameters into another object for easier specification and passing (config file?) #done
-remove mapping to canonical sequence positions from compute_networks; easier to compare multiple canonicals this way
-make it easier to compute alternate statistics - different acc/rep defs, etc. after having already done the network scoring
-make restarts easier
-improve __str__ for the pipeline, giving help message with a summary of the program options
-remove double counting of canonical sequence
-passing in parameters (angCut, linSep) to the CASP contact calculator

-have to think about pruning.  need to prune to produce the reproducibility graph, but have to
NOT prune for any performance-string based accuracies to work.

CEPReproducibilityCalculator
-new reproducibility definitions:
  + 1.0 - spearman_footrule_distance(split1,split2)
  + 1.0 - kendall_tau_distance(split1,split2)
  + Kendall's W for the bootstrap (takes entire set of ranks!)

CEPPlotting:
-flag for turning legend on and off
-remove/update deprecated plotting functions

CEPStructures:
-fix up calculate_distances_offset


OVERALL
-would be nice if it was easy to do single-shot (full aligment calcs) with same interface #done
  +could calculate accuracy but not reproducibility or consensus graph #done 
-add voting as a separate function to the pipeline (different functionality - runs
list of methods, rank aggregates, etc.)
-disallowing bootstrap sampling would really clean things up
-current reproducibility calculations ALWAYS prune the graphs
-would be *great* longer-term to have reproducibility measures that don't involve any pruning?
except is there ANY way to get the consensus graph without pruning?
-python3 and PEP8 compatibility
-replace cPickle with pickle
